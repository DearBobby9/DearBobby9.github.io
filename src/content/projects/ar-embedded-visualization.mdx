## Overview

This project studies how embedded AR visualizations influence human reliance on AI during spatial decision-making tasks.

## Research Questions

- Does AR X-Ray guidance improve calibration of trust compared with 2D minimaps?
- How does visualization placement affect user confidence and task performance?
- What interaction patterns indicate over-reliance versus appropriate reliance?

## Method

Participants completed spatial tasks under multiple visualization conditions. We measured task accuracy, response time, confidence, and reliance behavior.

## Outcome

The work provides actionable guidance for designing AR assistance that encourages appropriate reliance on AI rather than blind acceptance.
