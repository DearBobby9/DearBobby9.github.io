## Overview

NoteV is a multimodal knowledge AI agent designed for lecture scenarios with smart glasses. The system captures what the learner sees and hears, then transforms it into structured notes in near real-time.

## How It Works

1. Smart glasses capture first-person video and audio during class.
2. The backend transcribes speech and parses visual context.
3. A multimodal pipeline merges events into clean, searchable notes.
