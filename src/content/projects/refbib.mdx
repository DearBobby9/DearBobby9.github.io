## Overview

RefBib extracts references from academic PDFs and resolves them into reliable BibTeX records. The goal is deterministic citation quality instead of hallucinated metadata.

## Pipeline

1. Parse reference sections from input PDFs.
2. Normalize candidate entries and query citation databases.
3. Rank and validate returned records before export.
