## Overview

Reality Proxy explores fluid mixed-reality interaction by decoupling manipulation from strict physical constraints through AI-powered abstract proxies.

## Core Idea

Instead of forcing one-to-one mapping between physical objects and virtual operations, users interact with adaptive proxy representations that preserve intent while reducing physical friction.

## Contributions

- A proxy-based interaction model for MR object manipulation
- Techniques for preserving task semantics under abstraction
- Evaluation of usability and interaction efficiency

## My Role

Contributed to interaction design, system implementation, and study preparation, with focus on balancing flexibility and user control.
