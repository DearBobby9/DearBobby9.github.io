The FIRST step when you get the tranfer offer from UMN

<!--more-->

This guide is divided into two main parts:

1. **Transferring Credits**: How to transfer credits from your previous school when entering the University of Minnesota Twin Cities (UMN-TC).

2. **Accelerating Graduation**: How to accelerate graduation by earning additional credits at community colleges like Minneapolis College (MCTC) after enrollment.

This article focuses on the **first part**.

## 1  |  Transferring _existing_ credits when you enter UMN‑TC

### 1.1  Send the right documents

1. **Order official, final transcripts** from every college you've attended (including summer or PSEO work). Transcripts must be sent _directly_ to UMN Admissions. When they arrive, you'll receive instructions to view your **Transfer Credit Report** in APAS. ([Office of Admissions, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities][1])
2. **Verify your coursework in _Transferology_**—UMN's public transfer database—to see how each course is likely to map before you apply. ([Office of Admissions, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities][2])
3. <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: larger; color: red;">[Important]</span> For Most of students coming from Universities in China Mainland, you should submit a course review form ([Form is here under "International Credits" column][17]) for each course you want to transfer into UMN. These courses will be reviewed by the departments, who will show you the results (Approved or Denied) for your courses' equivalency. Once you got a email like this, this course could be considered as successfully transfered into UMN if a exact course number is assigned. Otherwised, the credits are only for the general requirments but not specific ones.

### 1.2  Understand what _will_ (and won't) transfer

| **Category**                  | **Usually transfers**                                        | **Usually does _not_ transfer**                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Academic/liberal‑arts courses | Intro math, natural & social sciences, humanities            | Remedial/developmental, study‑skills, orientation |
| Minimum grade                 | C‑ or higher ("C" for English comp)                          | Grades below C‑                                   |
| Source school                 | Regionally accredited U.S. or recognized foreign institution | Unaccredited institutions                         |

_Details are spelled out in the official **Transfer Credit Policy**._ ([明尼苏达大学双城校区招生办公室][3], [明尼苏达大学双城校区招生办公室][4])

> **Tip –** If a course **isn't** in Transferology but you believe it matches a UMN class, submit a **Transfer Course Petition** (one‑page PDF + syllabus). ([明尼苏达大学双城校区招生办公室][3])

### 1.3  Meet Liberal Education & residency rules

- **Liberal Education:** Admissions decides which incoming courses satisfy the **12 Core & Theme LE requirements**. (You need 7 Core + 4 Themes.) ([cla.umn.edu][5])
- **Residency:** Regardless of total transfer hours, a UMN bachelor's degree requires **at least 30 credits taken at UMN‑TC, and 15 of your last 30 must be here; half of your 3xxx+ major credits must also be UMN‑TC courses.** ([policy.umn.edu][6], [cla.umn.edu][7])
- **Upper limits:** UMN will apply **up to 60 credits** from a two‑year college toward the 120‑credit degree, and up to **90** total transfer credits if they include four‑year work. (Practical ceiling = 90.) ([明尼苏达大学双城校区招生办公室][8])

## 2  |  Earning _new_ credits elsewhere **after** you matriculate

### 2.1  Plan the course (and timing)

1. **Map the requirement.** Use Transferology + your APAS degree audit to identify which LE, minor, or elective slot you want to fill.
2. **Check residency hours.** Make sure taking the course _off‑campus_ won't drop you below the 30‑credit / last‑15‑credit rules noted above. ([policy.umn.edu][6])
3. **Talk to your adviser** (and often your college's transfer specialist) _before_ you register elsewhere to confirm applicability. ([onestop.umn.edu][10], [policy.umn.edu][11])

### 2.2  Register at the host college

- **MCTC, Hennepin Tech, Normandale, etc.** – Apply as a visiting/non‑degree student and sign up for the target class (summer and online formats are popular).
- **UMN system campuses (e.g., Morris, Duluth):** File a **Multi‑Institution (Multi‑I) Enrollment** request in MyU—no separate admission needed. ([onestop.umn.edu][12], [morris.umn.edu][13])

### 2.3  Secure financial aid (if needed)

Taking classes simultaneously at UMN and another school? File a **Consortium Agreement** so aid is calculated on your combined credit load; aid pays at _one_ "home" school, so budget for upfront tuition at the host. ([Metro State University][14], [hennepintech.edu][15])

### 2.4  Transfer the credit back fast

1. **Finish the course with C‑ or higher.**
2. **Order an official transcript** to UMN Admissions immediately—this can shave a semester off your graduation clock. ([明尼苏达大学双城校区招生办公室][2])
3. **Re‑run APAS** to confirm everything posted in the right slot. If not, submit a quick **Technical Petition** in your college advising office.

### 2.5  Acceleration playbook

| **Fast‑track move**                                                                 | **Typical use case**                                             | **Key caveat**                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LE "theme" in 5‑week summer** at MCTC (e.g., _BIOL 1130 – Environmental Science_) | Knocks out **Environment Theme** & natural‑science w/ lab        | Watch science‑in‑residence rules for STEM majors                                    |
| **Online Intro Stats** from another UMN campus (Morris STAT 1601)                   | Satisfies **Math Thinking core**; 4‑cr course in 3‑week May term | Must file Multi‑I form; counts toward UMN residency so good for last‑30‑credit rule |
| **CLEP after freshman year**                                                        | Earns 3–6 credits & covers elective _cheaply_                    | CLEP still counts toward _60‑credit_ two‑year cap                                   |

### 🎓 _Bottom line_

By pairing a _smart_ initial credit transfer (using **Transferology**, petitions, and MnCAP where possible) with **strategic off‑campus coursework**—all while watching residency and financial‑aid rules—you can trim an entire semester (or more) off your UMN bachelor's timeline without sacrificing degree quality. Happy credit‑hunting!
