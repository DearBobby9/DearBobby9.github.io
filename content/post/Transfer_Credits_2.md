This is a guide for transfer students in UMN.

<!--more-->

You can bring in credits earned _before_ you enroll at the **University of Minnesota Twin Cities (UMN‑TC)** by having the Office of Admissions evaluate your official transcripts, and continue to pick up credits _after_ you enroll by taking pre‑approved courses at community colleges such as **Minneapolis College (MCTC)** and transferring them back. Below you’ll find a step‑by‑step playbook—complete with links, key forms, credit‑limit rules, and financial‑aid tips—to help you maximize every transferable credit and graduate sooner.

## 1  |  Transferring _existing_ credits when you enter UMN‑TC

### 1.1  Send the right documents

1. **Order official, final transcripts** from every college you’ve attended (including summer or PSEO work). Transcripts must be sent _directly_ to UMN Admissions. When they arrive, you’ll receive instructions to view your **Transfer Credit Report** in MyU. ([Office of Admissions, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities][1])
2. **Verify your coursework in *Transferology***—UMN’s public transfer database—to see how each course is likely to map before you apply. ([Office of Admissions, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities][2])

### 1.2  Understand what _will_ (and won’t) transfer

| **Category**                  | **Usually transfers**                                        | **Usually does *not* transfer**                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Academic/liberal‑arts courses | Intro math, natural & social sciences, humanities            | Remedial/developmental, study‑skills, orientation |
| Minimum grade                 | C‑ or higher (“C” for English comp)                          | Grades below C‑                                   |
| Source school                 | Regionally accredited U.S. or recognized foreign institution | Unaccredited institutions                         |

_Details are spelled out in the official **Transfer Credit Policy**._ ([明尼苏达大学双城校区招生办公室][3], [明尼苏达大学双城校区招生办公室][4])

> **Tip –** If a course **isn’t** in Transferology but you believe it matches a UMN class, submit a **Transfer Course Petition** (one‑page PDF + syllabus). ([明尼苏达大学双城校区招生办公室][3])

### 1.3  Meet Liberal Education & residency rules

- **Liberal Education:** Admissions decides which incoming courses satisfy the **12 Core & Theme LE requirements**. (You need 7 Core + 4 Themes.) ([cla.umn.edu][5])
- **Residency:** Regardless of total transfer hours, a UMN bachelor’s degree requires **at least 30 credits taken at UMN‑TC, and 15 of your last 30 must be here; half of your 3xxx+ major credits must also be UMN‑TC courses.** ([policy.umn.edu][6], [cla.umn.edu][7])
- **Upper limits:** UMN will apply **up to 60 credits** from a two‑year college toward the 120‑credit degree, and up to **90** total transfer credits if they include four‑year work. (Practical ceiling = 90.) ([明尼苏达大学双城校区招生办公室][8])

### 1.4  Special pathway – MnCAP

If you start at **Minneapolis College (MCTC)** or six other Metro State two‑year schools, enrolling in **MnCAP** guarantees transfer admission to selected UMN majors once you hit the required GPA & course list—an easy on‑ramp for LE credits. ([minneapolis.edu][9])

## 2  |  Earning _new_ credits elsewhere **after** you matriculate

### 2.1  Plan the course (and timing)

1. **Map the requirement.** Use Transferology + your APAS degree audit to identify which LE, minor, or elective slot you want to fill.
2. **Check residency hours.** Make sure taking the course _off‑campus_ won’t drop you below the 30‑credit / last‑15‑credit rules noted above. ([policy.umn.edu][6])
3. **Talk to your adviser** (and often your college’s transfer specialist) _before_ you register elsewhere to confirm applicability. ([onestop.umn.edu][10], [policy.umn.edu][11])

### 2.2  Register at the host college

- **MCTC, Hennepin Tech, Normandale, etc.** – Apply as a visiting/non‑degree student and sign up for the target class (summer and online formats are popular).
- **UMN system campuses (e.g., Morris, Duluth):** File a **Multi‑Institution (Multi‑I) Enrollment** request in MyU—no separate admission needed. ([onestop.umn.edu][12], [morris.umn.edu][13])

### 2.3  Secure financial aid (if needed)

Taking classes simultaneously at UMN and another school? File a **Consortium Agreement** so aid is calculated on your combined credit load; aid pays at _one_ “home” school, so budget for upfront tuition at the host. ([Metro State University][14], [hennepintech.edu][15])

### 2.4  Transfer the credit back fast

1. **Finish the course with C‑ or higher.**
2. **Order an official transcript** to UMN Admissions immediately—this can shave a semester off your graduation clock. ([明尼苏达大学双城校区招生办公室][2])
3. **Re‑run APAS** to confirm everything posted in the right slot. If not, submit a quick **Technical Petition** in your college advising office.

### 2.5  Acceleration playbook

| **Fast‑track move**                                                                 | **Typical use case**                                             | **Key caveat**                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LE “theme” in 5‑week summer** at MCTC (e.g., _BIOL 1130 – Environmental Science_) | Knocks out **Environment Theme** & natural‑science w/ lab        | Watch science‑in‑residence rules for STEM majors                                    |
| **Online Intro Stats** from another UMN campus (Morris STAT 1601)                   | Satisfies **Math Thinking core**; 4‑cr course in 3‑week May term | Must file Multi‑I form; counts toward UMN residency so good for last‑30‑credit rule |
| **CLEP after freshman year**                                                        | Earns 3–6 credits & covers elective _cheaply_                    | CLEP still counts toward _60‑credit_ two‑year cap                                   |

### 🎓 *Bottom line*

By pairing a _smart_ initial credit transfer (using **Transferology**, petitions, and MnCAP where possible) with **strategic off‑campus coursework**—all while watching residency and financial‑aid rules—you can trim an entire semester (or more) off your UMN bachelor’s timeline without sacrificing degree quality. Happy credit‑hunting!
